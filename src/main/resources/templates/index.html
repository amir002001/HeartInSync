        <p>For more than 60 years, Heart & Stroke has been dedicated to fighting heart disease and stroke. Our work has
            saved thousands of lives and improved the lives of millions of others. Youâ€™ll probably run into someone
            today who is alive and well thanks to the countless Canadians who have supported our cause with their time
            and donations.
            It could be the young boy you pass on the street whose heart defect was successfully mended thanks to
            life-saving research. Or the woman at the coffee shop whose stroke was treated with a clot-busting drug. Or
            the father whose hockey teammates saved his life with CPR.</p>
